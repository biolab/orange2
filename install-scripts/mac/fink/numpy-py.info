Description: N-dimensional array package for Python
DescDetail: <<
NumPy (formerly known as scipy_core) is the fundamental package needed
for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:

  - a powerful N-dimensional array object
  - sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
  - tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
  - useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities.

Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an
efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary
data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and
speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.
