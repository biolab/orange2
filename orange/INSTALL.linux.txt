This document explains how to compile and install Orange on a Linux system. 
The following commands were tested on Ubuntu 9.04 and should be modified 
accordingly for other distributions. 

1. OBTAINING SOURCES

You can download the Orange's nightly packed sources from  
http://www.ailab.si/orange/nightly_builds.html and extract the archive.

An alternative is to check out the newest revision directly from SVN 
repository. In latter case, the following should do the job:

sudo apt-get install subversion # install the SVN client

svn co http://www.ailab.si/svn/orange/trunk/orange
cd orange
svn co http://www.ailab.si/svn/orange/trunk/source

2. DEPENDENCIES

2.1 For Python scripting 

If you only need the scripting interface, accessible through python, 
the dependencies are easier to fulfil. Only the common building tools and 
python extensions for imaging, graphs and computation with matrices are needed.

sudo apt-get install make g++ python-dev python-numarray-ext python-numpy-ext python-numeric-ext python-matplotlib python-imaging

This suffices for Orange scripting version to work.

2.2 Orange Canvas (widgets)

If you would like to use Orange Canvas, you will need to install PyQWT 5.1.
 To fulfil its compilation dependencies on Ubuntu 9.04 use:

sudo apt-get install python-qt4-dev libqwt5-qt4-dev pyqt4-dev-tools sip4

Download PyQWT version 5.1.0 (.tar.gz package) from:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyqwt/files/

Extract it and move inside the extracted folder. Next, use the following. 
For other systems, substitute the install path with your python package
directory.

cd configure
python configure.py -Q ../qwt-5.1 --module-install-path=/usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/PyQt4/Qwt5
make
sudo make install

3. COMPILING AND INSTALLING ORANGE

Move to the directory containing the downloaded Orange's sources. Compile the 
C++ sources:

cd source
make
cd .. #to move to main orange directory

Transfer files. Tar is used instead of cp because it can exclude unnecessary 
files and keeps symbolic links. For other systems, substitute the install path
with your python package directory.

sudo mkdir /usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/orange
tar -cf - --exclude='.svn' * | sudo tar --no-same-owner -xf - -C /usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/orange

sudo sh -c "echo '/usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/orange' > /usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/orange.pth"
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/orange/liborange.so /usr/lib/liborange.so

4. RUNNING

To use Orange in python scripts, try importing "orange" and "orngStat" 
in python interpreter. It should work flawlessly.

You can run the Orange Canvas (widgets) with:
python /usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/orange/OrangeCanvas/orngCanvas.pyw
