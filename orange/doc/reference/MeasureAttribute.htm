<H1>Relevance of Attributes</H1>

<P>There's a number of different measures for assessing the relevance of attributes. Orange implements some of them in the classes stemming from <CODE>MeasureAttribute</CODE>. The most of common ones compute certain statistics on conditional distributions of class values given the attribute values; in Orange, these are derived from <CODE>MeasureAttributeFromProbabilities</CODE>.</P>

<HR>

<H2>Base Classes</H2>

<H3>MeasureAttribute</H3>

<P><CODE>MeasureAttribute</CODE> is the base class for a wide range of classes that measure quality of attributes. The class itself is, naturally, abstract. Its fields merely describe what kinds of attributes it can handle and what kind of data it requires.</P>

<P class=section>Attributes</P>
<DL class=attributes>
<DT>handlesDiscrete</DT>
<DD>Tells whether the measure can handle discrete attributes.</DD>

<DT>handlesContinuous</DT>
<DD>Tells whether the measure can handle continuous attributes.</DD>

<DT>needs</DT>
<DD>Tells what kind of data the measure needs. This can be either <CODE>MeasureAttribute.NeedsGenerator</CODE>, <CODE>MeasureAttribute.NeedsDomainContingency</CODE> or <CODE>MeasureAttribute.NeedsContingency_Class</CODE>. The first need an example generator (Relief is an example of such measure), the second can compute the quality from <a href="contingency.htm"><CODE>DomainContingency</CODE></A> and the latter only needs the contingency (<CODE>ContingencyAttrClass</CODE>) the attribute distribution and the apriori class distribution. Most of the measure are content by the latter.</DD>
</DL>

<P>Several (but not all) measures can treat unknown attribute values in different ways, depending on field <B><CODE>unknownsTreatment</CODE></B> (this field is not defined in <CODE>MeasureAttribute</CODE> but in many derived classes). Undefined values can be
<UL style="margin-top=0cm">
<LI><B>ignored (<CODE>MeasureAttribute.IgnoreUnknowns</CODE>)</B>; this has the same effect as if the example for which the attribute value is unknown are removed.</LI>

<LI><B>punished (<CODE>MeasureAttribute.ReduceByUnknown</CODE>)</B>; the attribute quality is reduced by the proportion of unknown values. In impurity measures, this can be interpreted as if the impurity is decreased only on examples for which the value is defined and stays the same for the others, and the attribute quality is the average impurity decrease.</B></LI>

<LI><B>imputed (<CODE>MeasureAttribute.UnknownsToCommon</CODE>)</B>; here, undefined values are replaced by the most common attribute value. If you want a more clever imputation, you should do it in advance.</LI>

<LI><B>treated as a separate value (<CODE>MeasureAttribute.UnknownsAsValue</CODE>)</B>
</UL>

<P>The default treatment is <CODE>ReduceByUnknown</CODE>, which is optimal in most cases and does not make additional presumptions (as, for instance, <CODE>UnknownsToCommon</CODE> which supposes that missing values are not for instance, results of measurements that were not performed due to information extracted from the other attributes). Use other treatments if you know that they make better sense on your data.</P>

<P>The only method supported by all measures is the call operator to which we pass the data and get the number representing the quality of the attribute. The number does not have any absolute meaning and can vary widely for different attribute measures. The only common characteristic is that higher the value, better the attribute. If the attribute is so bad that it's quality cannot be measured, the measure returns <CODE>MeasureAttribute.Rejected</CODE>. None of the measures described here do so.</P>

<P>There are different sets of arguments that the call operator can accept. Not all classes will accept all kinds of arguments. Relief, for instance, cannot be computed from contingencies alone. Besides, the attribute and the class need to be of the correct type for a particular measure.</P>

<P class=section>Methods</P>
<DL class=attributes>
 <DT>__call__(attribute, examples[, apriori class distribution][, weightID])<br>
 __call__(attribute, domain contingency[, apriori class distribution])<br>
 __call__(contingency, class distribution[, apriori class distribution])</DT>

<DD>There are three call operators just to make your life simpler and faster. When working with the data, your method might have already computed, for instance, contingency matrix. If so and if the quality measure you use is OK with that (as most measures are), you can pass the contingency matrix and the measure will compute much faster. If, on the other hand, you only have examples and haven't computed any statistics on them, you can pass examples (and, optionally, an id for meta-attribute with weights) and the measure will compute the contingency itself, if needed.</P>

<P>Argument <CODE>attribute</CODE> gives the attribute whose quality is to be assessed. This can be either a descriptor, an index into domain or a name. In the first form, if the attribute is given by descriptor, it doesn't need to be in the domain. It needs to be computable from the attribute in the domain, though.</DD>

<P>The data is given either as <CODE>examples</CODE> (and, optionally, id for meta-attribute with weight), <CODE>domain contingency</CODE> (a list of contingencies) or <CODE>contingency</CODE> matrix and <CODE>class distribution</CODE>. If you use the latter form, what you should give as the class distribution depends upon what you do with unknown values (if there are any). If <CODE>unknownsTreatment</CODE> is <CODE>IgnoreUnknowns</CODE>, the class distribution should be computed on examples for which the attribute value is defined. Otherwise, class distribution should be the overall class distribution.</P>

<P>The optional argument with <CODE>apriori class distribution</CODE> is most often ignored. It comes handy if the measure makes any probability estimates based on apriori class probabilities (such as m-estimate).</P>
</DD>
</DL>

<P>The script below shows different ways to assess the quality of astigmatic, tear rate and the first attribute (whichever it is) in the dataset lenses.</P>

<p class="header"><a href="MeasureAttribute1.py">part of measureattribute1.py</a>
(uses <a href="lenses.tab">lenses.tab</a>)</p>
<XMP class=code>import orange, random
data = orange.ExampleTable("lenses")

meas = orange.MeasureAttribute_info()

astigm = data.domain["astigmatic"]
print "Information gain of 'astigmatic': %6.4f" % meas(astigm, data)

classdistr = orange.Distribution(data.domain.classVar, data)
cont = orange.ContingencyAttrClass("tear_rate", data)
print "Information gain of 'tear_rate': %6.4f" % meas(cont, classdistr)

dcont = orange.DomainContingency(data)
print "Information gain of the first attribute: %6.4f" % meas(0, dcont)
print
</XMP>

<P>As for many other classes in Orange, you can construct the object and use it on-the-fly. For instance, to measure the quality of attribute "tear_rate", you could write simply</P>

<XMP class=code>>>> print orange.MeasureAttribute_info("tear_rate", data)
0.548794984818
</XMP>

<P>It is also possible to assess the quality of attributes that do not exist in the dataset. For instance, you can assess the quality of discretized attributes without constructing a new domain and dataset that would include them.</P>

<p class="header"><a href="MeasureAttribute1.py">measureattribute1a.py</a>
(uses <a href="iris.tab">iris.tab</a>)</p>
<XMP class=code>import orange, random
data = orange.ExampleTable("iris")

d1 = orange.EntropyDiscretization("petal length", data)
print orange.MeasureAttribute_info(d1, data)
</XMP>

<P>The quality of the new attribute <CODE>d1</CODE> is assessed on <CODE>data</CODE>, which does not include the new attribute at all. (Note that ReliefF won't do that since it would be too slow. ReliefF requires the attribute to be present in the dataset.)</p>

<P>Finally, you can compute the quality of meta-attributes. The following script adds a meta-attribute to an example table, initializes it to random values and measures its information gain.</P>

<p class="header"><a href="MeasureAttribute1.py">part of measureattribute1.py</a>
(uses <a href="lenses.tab">lenses.tab</a>)</p>
<XMP class=code>mid = orange.newmetaid()
data.domain.addmeta(mid, orange.EnumVariable(values = ["v0", "v1"]))
data.addMetaAttribute(mid)

rg = random.Random()
rg.seed(0)
for ex in data:
    ex[mid] = orange.Value(rg.randint(0, 1))

print "Information gain for a random meta attribute: %6.4f" % \
  orange.MeasureAttribute_info(mid, data)
</XMP>


<H3>MeasureAttributeFromProbabilities</H3>

<P><CODE>MeasureAttributeFromProbabilities</CODE> is the abstract base class for attribute quality measures that can be computed from contingency matrices only. It relieves the derived classes from having to compute the contingency matrix by defining the first two forms of call operator. (Well, that's not something you need to know if you only work in Python.) Additional feature of this class is that you can set probability estimators. If none are given, probabilities and conditional probabilities of classes are estimated by relative frequencies.</P>

<P class=section>Attributes</P>
<DL class=attributes>
<DT>unknownsTreatment</DT>
<DD>Defines what to do with unknown values. See the possibilities described above.</DD>

<DT>estimatorConstructor, conditionalEstimatorConstructor</DT>
<DD>The classes that are used to estimate unconditional and conditional probabilities of classes, respectively. You can set this to, for instance, <CODE>ProbabilityEstimatorConstructor_m</CODE> and <CODE>ConditionalProbabilityEstimatorConstructor_ByRows</CODE> (with estimator constructor again set to <CODE>ProbabilityEstimatorConstructor_m</CODE>), respectively.</DD>
</DL>

<XMP class=code>

<H2>Measures for Classification Problems</H2>

<P>The following section describes the attribute quality measures suitable for discrete attributes and outcomes. See <A href="MeasureAttribute1.py">MeasureAttribute1.py</A>, <A href="MeasureAttribute1a.py">MeasureAttribute1a.py</A>, <A href="MeasureAttribute1b.py">MeasureAttribute1b.py</A>, <A href="MeasureAttribute2.py">MeasureAttribute2.py</A> and <A href="MeasureAttribute3.py">MeasureAttribute3.py</A> for more examples on their use.</P>

<H3>Information Gain</H3>

<P>The most popular measure, information gain (<CODE>MeasureAttribute_info</CODE>), measures the expected decrease of the entropy.</P>

<H3>Gain Ratio</H3>

<P>Gain ratio (<CODE>MeasureAttribute_gainRatio </CODE>) was introduced by Quinlan in order to avoid overestimation of multi-valued attributes. It is computed as information gain divided by the entropy of the attribute's value. (It has been shown, however, that such measure still overstimates the attributes with multiple values.)

<H3>Gini index</H3>

<P>Gini index (<CODE>MeasureAttribute_gini</CODE>) was first introduced by Breiman and can be interpreted as the probability that two randomly chosen examples will have different classes.</P>

<H3>Relevance</H3>

<P>Relevance of attributes (<CODE>MeasureAttribute_relevance</CODE>) is a measure that discriminate between attributes on the basis of their potential value in the formation of decision rules.</P>

<H3>Costs</H3>

<P><CODE>MeasureAttribute_cost</CODE> evaluates attributes based on the "saving" achieved by knowing the value of attribute, according to the specified cost matrix.</P>

<P class=section>Attributes</P>
<DL class=attributes>
<DT>cost</DT>
<DD>Cost matrix (see the page about <A href="CostMatrix.htm">cost matrices</A> for details)</DD>
</DL>

<P>If cost of predicting the first class for an example that is actually in the second is 5, and the cost of the opposite error is 1, than an appropriate measure can be constructed and used for attribute 3 as follows.</P>

<XMP class=code>>>> meas = orange.MeasureAttribute_cost()
>>> meas.cost = ((0, 5), (1, 0))
>>> meas(3, data)
0.083333350718021393
</XMP>

<P>This tells that knowing the value of attribute 3 would decrease the classification cost for appx 0.083 per example.</P>


<H3>ReliefF</H3>

<P>ReliefF (<CODE>MeasureAttribute_relief</CODE>) was first developed by Kira and Rendell and then substantially generalized and improved by Kononenko. It measures the usefulness of attributes based on their ability to distinguish between very similar examples belonging to different classes.</P>

<P class=section>Attributes</P>
<DL class=attributes>
<DT>k</DT>
<DD>Number of neighbours for each example. Default is 5.</DD>

<DT>m</DT>
<DD>Number of reference examples. Default is 100.</DD>
</DL>

<P>Computation of ReliefF is rather slow since it needs to find <CODE>k</CODE> nearest neighbours for each of <CODE>m</CODE> reference examples. Since we normally compute ReliefF for all attributes in the dataset, <CODE>MeasureAttribute_relief</CODE> caches the results. When it is called to compute a quality of certain attribute, it computes qualities for all attributes in the dataset. When called again, it uses the stored results if the domain is still the same and the example table has not changed (this is done by checking the example tables <CODE>version</CODE> and is not foolproof; it won't detect if you change values of existing examples, but will notice adding and removing examples; see information on <A href="ExampleTable.htm"><CODE>ExampleTable</CODE></A> for details).</P>

<P>Caching will only have effect if you use the same instance for all attributes in the domain. So, don't do this:</P>

<XMP class=code>for attr in data.domain.attributes:
    print orange.MeasureAttribute_relief(attr, data)
</XMP>

<P>In this script, cached data dies together with the instance of <CODE>MeasureAttribute_relief</CODE>, which is constructed and destructed for each attribute separately. It's way faster to go like this.</P>

<XMP class=code>meas = orange.MeasureAttribute_relief()
for attr in data.domain.attributes:
    print meas(attr, data)
</XMP>

<P>When called for the first time, <CODE>meas</CODE> will compute ReliefF for all attributes and the subsequent calls simply return the stored data.</P>

<P>Class <CODE>MeasureAttribute_relief</CODE> works on discrete and continuous classes and thus implements functionality of algorithms ReliefF and RReliefF.</P>


<H2>Measure for Attributes for Regression Problems</H2>

<P>Except for ReliefF, the only attribute quality measure available for regression problems is based on a mean square error.</P>

<H3>Mean Square Error</H3>

<P>The mean square error measure is implemented in class <CODE>MeasureAttribute_MSE</CODE>.</P>

<P class=section>Attributes</P>
<DL class=attributes>
<DT>unknownsTreatment</DT>
<DD>Tells what to do with unknown attribute values. See description on the top of this page.</DD>

<DT>m</DT>
<DD>Parameter for m-estimate of error. Default is 0 (no m-estimate).
