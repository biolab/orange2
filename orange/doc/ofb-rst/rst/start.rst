Start with Python and Orange
============================

To start Orange scripting, you will need to `download
<www.ailab.si/orange/download.html>`_ and install Orange. Python can
be run in a window with a terminal, special integrated environments
(like PythonWin), or shells like `iPython
<http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/>`_. If you are a windows user,
PythonWin comes with *full package* Orange instalation. Just like
iPython (which, if you chose so, will need to install separately),
PythonWin includes support for code completion feature. Orange come
with many classes and functions, and it helps if editor can help you
find the right names for them. Here is a screenshot of PythonWin
with this feature:

.. image:: python_win.*

and a similar screenshot for iPython (use <TAB> key for code
completion):

.. image:: ipython.*
   :alt: Orange in iPython

Whichever environment you are using, try now to import Orange (just
type import Orange, brackets are in the following to denote shell's
prompt):

>>> import orange
>>> 

If this leaves no error and warning, Orange and python are properly
installed and you are ready to continue with this Tutorial.
