<H1>Orange for Beginners</H1>

<br>

<p>If you are new to Orange, than this is probably the best place
to start. &ldquo;Beginning with Orange&rdquo; was written with a
purpose to provide a gentle tutorial over basic functionality of
Orange. The tutorial includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>  <A href="start.htm">Start with Orange</A> shows hot to run python and import Orange,</li>
<li>  <A href="load_data.htm">Load-in the data</A> speaks about data formats and how to load the read the data from files,</li>
<li>  <A href="basic_exploration.htm">Basic data exploration</A> demonstrates how to perform some basic statistical analysis, </li>

<li>  <A href="classification.htm">Classification</A> talks about how to set-up the learners, build classifiers, and evaluate them using cross-validation or alike, </li>
   <ul>
   <li><A href="c_basics.htm">My first Orange classifier</A> builds naive Bayesian classifier and shows how to use to predict class labels and probabilities,</li>
   <li><A href="c_otherclass.htm">Selected classification methods</A> lists other classification methods provided by Orange,</li>
   <li><A href="c_performance.htm">Testing and evaluating</A> speaks about a very important task of testing and comparison of learners, </li>
   <li><A href="c_pythonlearner.htm">Build your own learner</A> is a very important chapter on how to build your own learners: Orange is a framework for experimental machine learning, and in prototyping and testing new methods is where it shines the most, </li>
       <ul>
       <li><A href="c_nb_disc.htm">Naive Bayes with Discretization</A> shows hot to couple categorization and naive Bayes learner and how to wrap-it up in a new class, </li>
       <li><A href="c_nb.htm">Naive Bayes in Python</A> a complete reimplementation of naive Bayes in Python. It can handle only discrete attributes, and does noting else (but slower) than Orange's own naive Bayes, but the example script may help you in prototyping your own learning methods, </li>
       <li><A href="c_bagging.htm">Bagging</A> shows how to implement a class for bagging. If you are into ensemble learning, this is a section for you,</li>
       </ul>
</ul>

<li><A href="regression.htm">Regression</A> introduces several methods that can be used for regression modelling, </li>
<li><A href="assoc.htm">Association Rules</A> shows how to use Orange's association rules, </li>
<li><A href="other.htm">Other topics</A></li>
   <ul>
   <li><A href="o_categorization.htm">Categorization</A> lists several methods within Orange that can be used for categorization, </li>
   <li><A href="o_fss.htm">Feature subset selection</A></li>
   <li><A href="o_ensemble.htm">Ensemble techniques</A> discusses how to use a particular Orange's module for boosting and bagging, </li>
   </ul>

<li><A href="domain.htm">Basic Data Manipulation</A> illustrates how to select attributes, instances, craft new domains and data sets, and alike. Finishes with wrapper-based feature subset selector, </li>
<li><A href="uncovered.htm">What we did not cover</A></li>
</ul>

<p>As Orange is integrated within Python, the tutorial is in
essence a guide through some basic Orange scripting in this
language. Although relying on Python, those of you who have some
knowledge on programming won&rsquo;t need to learn Python first:
the tutorial should be simple enough to skip learning Python
itself. If, however, you will later want to develop your own
methods and test some of your more complex ideas, you may want to
jump to <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python&rsquo;s site</a>
for some material on this rather new and appealing scripting
language.</p>

<p>Through the tutorial, some basic python scripts are developed
that most often read the data and do something with it. You will
find that every piece of code we present has a pointer to the file
with this code that you can download (use the mouse, press
right-button on the link, and choose &ldquo;Save Target As
&hellip;&rdquo;. You will also find that with it are pointers to
the data files that you can download too. We recommend you to first
open a special folder where you want to save both the scripts and
files that come with them.</p>

<p>We expect this tutorial to be interactive, that is, we would
like you to try Orange while reading the tutorial. Hence, we start
with the basics on <a href="start.htm">where to download Python and
Orange and how to start Orange scripting</a>.</p>

<p>For your convenience, you may also download a
<a href="http://magix.fri.uni-lj.si/orange/download/doc.zip">stand-alone
version of Orange documentation</a> that also includes
all script files and data files.</p>
