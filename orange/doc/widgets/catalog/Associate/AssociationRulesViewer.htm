<h1>Association Rules Viewer</h1>

<img class="screenshot" src="../icons/AssociationRulesViewer.png">
<p>A widget for printing out the rules and for their manual exploration and selection.</p>

<h2>Channels</h2>

<h3>Inputs</h3>

<DL class=attributes>
<DT>Association Rules</DT>
<DD>A list of rules</DD>
</dl>

<h3>Outputs</h3>
<DL class=attributes>
<DT>Association Rules</DT>
<DD>Selected rules</DD>

</dl>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This widget can be used for three purposes:
<ul><li>graphically showing the confidence and support of the induced rules</li>
<li>selecting a subset of rules based on their confidence and support</li>
<li>listing the induced rules and the corresponding measures of quality</li>
</ul>
</p>

<img class="screenshot" src="AssociationRulesViewer.png" alt="Association Rules Viewer Widget" border=0>

<P>The columns of the grid on the left hand side of the widget represent different supports and the rows represents confidences. The scale is given above the grid: for the case in this snapshot, support goes from 28% to 75% and the confidence ranges from 29% to 100%. Each cell is colored according to the number of rules with that particular support and confidence - the darker the cell, the more rules are inside it.</P>

<P>You can select a part of the grid. In the snapshot we selected the rules with supports between 36% and 66% and confidences from 33% to 82%.</P>

<P>When the widget receives certain data, it shows the area containing all the rules. You can <span class="option">Zoom</span> in to enlarge the selected part, push <span class="option">Show All</span> to see the region with the rules again, or <span class="option">No Zoom</span> to see the region with support and confidence from 0 to 1. <span class="option">Unselect</span> removes the selection.</P>

<P>If nothing is selected, the widget outputs all rules.</P>

<P>On the right hand side of the widget there is a list of the selected rules. The checkboxes above can be used to select the measures of rule quality that we are interested in. Let L, R and B be the number of examples that fit the left, the right and both sides of the rule, respectively, and N the total number of examples in the data set. The measures are then defined as follows
<ul>
<li>support = B / N</li>
<li>confidence = B / L</li>
<li>coverage = L / N</li>
<li>strength = R / L</li>
<li>lift = N * B / (L * R)</li>
<li>leverage = N * B - L * R</li>
</ul>
</P>

<P>With the buttons below you can <span class="option">Save Rules</span> into a tab-delimited file or <span class="option">Send Rules</span> to the widget connected to the output. The latter is only enabled if <span class="option">Send rules automatically</span> is unchecked. When it is checked, the rules are put on the widget's output automatically at every selection change.</P>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<P>This widget is used with the <a href="AssociationRules.htm">Association Rules</a> and maybe with a tree-like <a href="AssociationRulesTreeViewer.htm">Association Rules Tree Viewer</a>. The typical schema is shown below.</P>
