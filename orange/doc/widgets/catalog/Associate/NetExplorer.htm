<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Net Explorer visualizes graphs, lets the user explore them by selecting their 
individual parts and gives the corresponding data to other widgets. It is currently available 
only in the latest (Qt4) version of Orange.</p>

<p>More information on the use the widget from Python is available in documentation on <a href="../../../modules/orngNetwork.htm">
orngNetwork Orange module</a>.</p>

<h3>Navigation</h3>
<p>Four navigation buttons are located in the upper right corner of the control area.</p>

<table>
<tr valign="top"><td><img class="leftscreenshot" src="NetExplorer-navigation.png"/></td>

<td>
<p><i>Zooming:</i></p>
<p>Zooming mode is selected by default. User can zoom in a rectangle by pressing and holding the 
left mouse button and dragging the mouse to draw a rectangle to zoom in to. Zoom out (one level) 
command can then be executed by pressing right mouse button.</p>

<p><i>Zoom to extent:</i></p>
<p>By pressing this button the zoom is automatically set to show all visible nodes in the network.</p>

<p><i>Zoom selection:</i></p>
<p>By pressing this button the zoom is automatically set to show all selected nodes in the network.</p>

<p><i>Panning:</i></p>
<p>Use this mode to drag the network around the canvas.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Marking and Selecting</h3>
<p>The widget features a two-stage procedure for selection of vertices, which allows for a very flexible
manipulation of subsets of vertices. Vertices can be marked and/or selected. Marked vertices are presented
by filled circled and selected vertices are highlighted with a yellow border.</p>

<table>
<tr valign="top"><td><img class="leftscreenshot" src="NetExplorer-select.png"/></td>

<td>
<p>Vertices can be selected manually by clicking or by drawing selection rectangle. Selection mode is 
enabled by pressing fifth button from the top in the upper right corner in control area.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><img class="leftscreenshot" src="NetExplorer-MarkSelect.png"/></td>
<td> Another way to
select vertices is to add or remove the marked vertices to or from the selection, or to replace the 
current selection with the marked vertices (buttons seven to nine).</p>
</td></tr>
</table>
<p>The vertices can be marked based upon values of the attributes of the corresponding objects. Most marking
options are available in the Mark Tab.</p>

<h3>Vertices Tab</h3>

<img class="leftscreenshot" src="NetExplorer-Vertices.png"/>
<p>Parameters in vertices tab govern the appearance of network vertices and data associated with them. 
User can select optimization method, vertex color and size attribute, set the labels and tooltips and 
other rendering options.</p>

<h4><b>Optimization methods</b></h4>
<dl>
<dt>No optimization</dt>
<dd>The vertices are left as they are. If the
 given network object already contains the vertices placement
 data (these can be given, for instance, in Pajek format), they
 are placed accordingly, otherwise their positions are random.</dd>
 
<dt>Random</dt>
<dd>The vertices are scattered randomly.</dd>

<dt>Fruchterman-Reingold</dt>
<dd> The standard Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm, which
 tries to put the pairs of connected vertices to a certain fixed
 small distance and the unconnected ones to the fixed large
 distance. A simulated annealing optimization algorithm is used
 to minimize the stress of the solution.</dd>
 
<dt>Fruchterman-Reingold Weighted</dt>
<dd> A variation of the Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm which also
 takes the edge weights into account: the larger the weight, the
 smaller the desired distance between the two vertices.</dd>
 
<dt>Fruchterman-Reingold Radial</dt>
<dd> A Fruchterman-Reingold-type algorithm which places a vertex
 selected by the user at the center of the graph and optimizes
 the layout around it. The optimization procedure ensures that
 vertices with shorter paths to the central vertex are closer to
 it than those with longer paths.</dd>
 
<dt>Circular</dt>
<dd> The vertices are placed around the circle in the same order in
 which they are given in the data.</dd>

<dt>Circular crossing reduction</dt>
<dd> A local optimization algorithm which puts the vertices on the
 circle and tries to minimize the number of crossed edges.</dd>
 
<dt>Circular random</dt>
<dd> The vertices are placed randomly around the circle.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The user can specify the number of iterations of the optimization procedure where applicable.</p>

<h4>Labels and tooltips</h4>

<p>One or more attributes can be chosen to be shown as <span class="option">Vertex labels or tooltips</span>.
To reduce the visual clutter, the user can also decide to <span class="option">Show labels on marked vertices only</span>.
Checking <span class="option">Inside view</span> enables a special mode in which only selected vertex and vertices
closer to it than the specified distance (in terms of the number of connections, not their lengths) are shown.</p>

<p><span class="option">Show missing values</span> decides whether missing values should be displayed (as question marks).</p>

<h3 style="clear: both">Edges Tab</h3>

<img class="leftscreenshot" src="NetExplorer-Edges.png">

<p>Parameters in edges tab are used to specify the appearance of edges. One can set edges color, width and 
whether weights of edges are displayed.</p>

<p>When <span class="option">Explore vertex distances</span> is selected, the user can examine the distance between vertices, as given in the "Vertex Distance" signal. To display the distance, one must first select a vertex. When hovering over an arbitrary vertex, the distance between the selected vertex and the vertex under the mouse pointer is displayed as a popup.</p>

<h3 style="clear: both">Mark Tab</h3>

<img class="leftscreenshot" src="NetExplorer-Mark.png">

<p>Most options for interactive network exploration are gathered here. User can search for nodes by value in items meta 
data, mark neighbours of selected vertices or mark vertices by number of connections.</p>

<!-- mislim, da tole ni potrebno, saj je ocitno iz slike. bi pa bilo to smiselno nasteti, ce bi o vsakem kaj povedal. a skoraj ni kaj
<p><i>Complete list of marking features:</i></p>
<ul>
<li>mark neighbours of focused vertex,</li>
<li>mark neighbours of selected vertex,</li>
<li>mark vertices with at list N connections,</li>
<li>mark vertices with at most N connections,</li>
<li>mark vertices with more connections than any neighbour,</li>
<li>mark vertices with more connections than average neighbour,</li>
<li>find hubs (vertices with the most connections),</li>
<li>mark vertices specified in input signal (Items to Mark signal).</li>
</ul>
-->

<h3 style="clear: both">Info Tab</h3>

<img class="leftscreenshot" src="NetExplorer-Info.png">

<p>The info tab gives some general information (such as number of vertices, number of edges, diameter, clustering coefficient) about the network. Button <span class="option">Degree Distribution</span> calculates and displays the degree distribution. Finally, the network can be saved in <a href="http://pajek.imfm.si/doku.php">Pajek</a> format by clicking on <span class="option">Save network</span> button.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>The best way to get to know how to use this widget is by playing with it. Try some of the following network data sets:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="NetExplorer-K2K4.net">K2K4</a>, a network containing two full graphs (one with 2 vertices, other with 4);</li>
<li><a href="NetExplorer-K8.net">K8</a>, ful graph with 8 vertices;</li>
<li><a href="NetExplorer-Cube.net">cube</a>, a cube;</li>
<li><a href="NetExplorer-Star.net">star</a>, a star with 6 vertices;</li>
<li><a href="NetExplorer-Rose.net">rose</a>, a rose like graph with 19 vertices;</li>
<li><a href="NetExplorer-Lattice.net">lattice</a>, a lattice with 100 vertices;</li>
<li><a href="NetExplorer-lastfm_artists.net">last.fm network</a> and <a href="NetExplorer-lastfm_artists.tab">last.fm items</a>, a network where similar artists are connected. Data was aquired from the <a href="http://www.last.fm/">last.fm web site</a>.</li>
</ul>
