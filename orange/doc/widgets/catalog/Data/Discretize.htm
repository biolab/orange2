<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Discretize widget receives a data set on the input, finds
attributes that are continuous and discretizes them using selected
method. It then outputs the same data set with continuous attributes
replaced by their discretized version.</p>

<p>Three discretization methods are supported. Continuous attributes
are either discretized using a set of intervals of the same size
(<span class="option">Equal-Width Intervals</span>), using a set of intervals where interval
borders are defined so that each interval covers approximately equal
number of data instances (<span class="option">Equal-Frequency Intervals</span>). Number of
intervals is user-defined.</p>

<p>A different technique is <span class="option">Entropy-based
discretization</span>, which works only if an input data set includes a
discrete class and finds intervals so that these minimize the entropy
of the class variable (e.g., intervals tend to include instances of
some prevailing class). The algorithm used is that of Fayyad and Irani
(1992). One possible outcome of the algorithm is that no appropriate
cut-off points are found, hence an attribute is reduced to a constant
and can be removed from the data set. Attributes of this kind are
listed under <span class="option">Removed Attributes</span>.</p>

<p>Depending on the user's settings, the widget can display either the
discretization intervals or the cut-off points, that is, interval borders.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>In the schema below we show Iris data set with continuous
attributes (as in original data file) and with discretized attributes.</p>
