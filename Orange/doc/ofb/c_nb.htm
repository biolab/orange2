<H1>My First Orange Classifier</H1>

<p>The naive Bayesian classification method we will implement in
this lesson uses standard naive Bayesian algorithm also described
in Michell: Machine Learning, 1997 (pages 177-180). Essentially, if
an instance is described with n attributes a<sub>i</sub> (i from 1
to n), then the class that instance is classified to a class v from
set of possible classes V according to naive Bayes classifier
is:</p>

<p>We will also compute a vector of elements</p>

<center><img src="f2.gif" alt="formula for pj"></center>

<p>which, after normalization so that the sum of elements is equal
to 1, will (also by Mitchell) denote the class probabilities. The
class probabilities and conditional probabilities (priors) in above
formulas are estimated from training data: class probability is
equal to the relative class frequency, while the conditional
probability of attribute value given class is computed by figuring
out the proportion of instances with a value of i-th attribute
equal to a<sub>i</sub> among instances that from class
v<sub>j</sub>.</p>

<p>To complicate things just a little bit, m-estimate (see
Mitchell, and Cestnik IJCAI-1990) will be used instead of relative
frequency when computing prior conditional probabilities. So
(following the example in Mitchell), when assessing
P=P(Wind=strong|PlayTennis=no) we find that the total number of
training examples with PlayTennis=no is n=5, and of these there are
nc=3 for which Wind=strong, than using relative frequency the
corresponding probability would be</p>

<p>Relative frequency has a problem when number of instance is
small, and to alleviate that m-estimate assumes that there are m
imaginary cases (m is also referred to as equivalent sample size)
with equal probability of class values p. Our conditional
probability using m-estimate is then computed as</p>

<p>Often, instead of uniform class probability p, a relative class
frequency as estimated from training data is taken.</p>

<p>We will develop a module called bayes.py that will implement our
naive Bayes learner and classifier. The structure of the module
will be as with <a href="c_nb_disc.htm">previous example</a>.
Again, we will implement two classes, one for learning and the other
on for classification. Here is a <code>Learner</code>: class</p>

<p class="header">class Learner_Class from <a href=
"bayes.py">bayes.py</a></p>
<xmp class="code">class Learner(object):
    def __new__(cls, examples=None, **kwds):
        learner = object.__new__(cls, **kwds)
        if examples:
            learner.__init__(**kwds)
            return learner(examples)
        else:
            return learner

    def __init__(self, m=0.0, name='std naive bayes', **kwds):
        self.__dict__.update(kwds)
        self.m = m
        self.name = name

    def __call__(self, examples, weight=None, **kwds):
        for k in kwds.keys():
            self.__dict__[k] = kwds[k]
        domain = examples.domain

        # first, compute class probabilities
        n_class = [0.] * len(domain.classVar.values)
        for e in examples:
            n_class[int(e.getclass())] += 1

        p_class = [0.] * len(domain.classVar.values)
        for i in range(len(domain.classVar.values)):
            p_class[i] = n_class[i] / len(examples)

        # count examples with specific attribute and
        # class value, pc[attribute][value][class]
        
        # initialization of pc
        pc = []
        for i in domain.attributes:
            p = [[0.]*len(domain.classVar.values) for i in range(len(i.values))]
            pc.append(p)

        # count instances, store them in pc
        for e in examples:
            c = int(e.getclass())
            for i in range(len(domain.attributes)):
                if not e[i].isSpecial():
                    pc[i][int(e[i])][c] += 1.0

        # compute conditional probabilities
        for i in range(len(domain.attributes)):
            for j in range(len(domain.attributes[i].values)):
                for k in range(len(domain.classVar.values)):
                    pc[i][j][k] = (pc[i][j][k] + self.m * p_class[k])/ \
                                  (n_class[k] + self.m)

        return Classifier(m = self.m, domain=domain, p_class=p_class, \
                                       p_cond=pc, name=self.name)    

</xmp>

<p>Initialization of Learner_Class saves the two attributes, m and
name of the classifier. Notice that both parameters are optional,
and the default value for m is 0, making naive Bayes m-estimate
equal to relative frequency unless the user specifies some other
value for m. Function <code>__call__</code> is called with the training data
set, computes class and conditional probabilities and calls
classifiers, passing the probabilities along with some other
variables required for classification.</p>

<p class="header">class Classifier from <a href="bayes.py">bayes.py</a></p>
<xmp class="code">class Classifier:
    def __init__(self, **kwds):
        self.__dict__.update(kwds)

    def __call__(self, example, result_type=orange.GetValue):
        # compute the class probabilities
        p = map(None, self.p_class)
        for c in range(len(self.domain.classVar.values)):
            for a in range(len(self.domain.attributes)):
                if not example[a].isSpecial():
                    p[c] *= self.p_cond[a][int(example[a])][c]
                    
        # normalize probabilities to sum to 1
        sum =0.
        for pp in p: sum += pp
        if sum>0:
            for i in range(len(p)): p[i] = p[i]/sum
            
        # find the class with highest probability
        v_index = p.index(max(p))
        v = orange.Value(self.domain.classVar, v_index)

        # return the value based on requested return type
        if result_type == orange.GetValue:
            return v
        if result_type == orange.GetProbabilities:
            return p
        return (v,p)
        
    def show(self):
        print 'm=', self.m
        print 'class prob=', self.p_class
        print 'cond prob=', self.p_cond
</xmp>


<p>Upon the first invocation, the classifier will store the values of
the parameters it was called with (<code>__init__</code>). When called with a
data instance, it will first compute the class probabilities using
the prior probabilities sent by the learner. The probabilities will
be normalized to sum to 1. The class will then be found that has
the highest probability, and the classifier will accordingly
predict to this class. Notice that we have also added a method
called show, which reports on m, class probabilities and
conditional probabilities:</p>

<p>The following script tests our naive Bayes, and compares it to
10-nearest neighbors. Running the script (do you it yourself)
reports classification accuracies just about 90% (somehow, on this
data set, kNN does better; smrc&hellip;).</p>
