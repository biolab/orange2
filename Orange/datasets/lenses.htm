 Notes:  This database is complete (all possible combinations of
         attribute-value pairs are represented).

         Each instance is complete and correct.

         9 rules cover the training set.

4. Relevant Information Paragraph:
    The examples are complete and noise free.
    The examples highly simplified the problem. The attributes do not
    fully describe all the factors affecting the decision as to which type,
    if any, to fit.

5. Number of Instances: 24

6. Number of Attributes: 4 (all nominal)

7. Attribute Information:
